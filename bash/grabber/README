Log grabber ver 0.0.3
======================

LG is a small bash script. It's goal is to simplify grabbing logs of any kind (via ssh) from group of remote servers.
It can grab pcap, debug log etc. It's designed with having in mind:
- modularity - one can add another grabbing module in several minutes
- convenience - it try to be as comfortable to use, as possible )

Typical usecase for LG is - you have several remote servers and you want to trace some events, SIP call for example.
Since call is traversed through several hosts, you definetely want to get logs from all of them and only for the period of this call.
So, you setup LG, start it and perform a call. That's all - you get a traces from all desired hosts.

WARNING: LG works via ssh, so you should be able to connect manually to every remote server via ssh

Features:
======================
- LG automatically ensures that it's possible to use password-less connection to remote servers
- LG automatically copies up to date version of itself and modules to remote servers
- LG sends keep-alive messages during the grabbing and automatically stops grabbing if client part has gone away - to prevent endless grabbing
- in case of broken connection, LG gives ability to stop grabbing and download files
- each grabbing has its own ID, so simultaneous grabbings are available

How to use
======================
1. Write a config file with list of remote servers and desired modules to be used
2. Start LG. It ensures that you have a password-less access to all servers. If you don't - LG will help you to copy you public key.
   LG also ensures, that there is a up to date version of LG and modules on remote side
3. Make a call
4. Press CTRL+C in LG's console and wait for all logs to be downloaded
5. PROFIT )

1. Write a config file:
Config file should declare a SERVERS variable in such format:
SERVERS="<nickname>:<host:port>:<comma-separated list of required modules>[ ...]"

For example
SERVERS="
	sipfe;root@192.168.64.133:22;tcpdump,sipfelog
	sem1;root@192.168.64.131:22;tlglog,syslog
	sem2;root@192.168.64.132:22;tlglog,syslog
"

WARNING: You MUST specify server's port, even if it's default one - 22

Here you can see three remote servers: sipfe, sem1, sem2. On sipfe LG will use tcpdump and sipfelog modules, on both sem - tlglog and syslog

2. Start LG. The most frequent case if to run all grabbing processes at once. In this case you need to start LG as:
 ./grabber.sh <config file>

There are some other options for other cases:
- ./grabber.sh <config file> continue <session ID> - continue grabbing session with <session ID> after any error
- ./grabber.sh <config file> stop <session ID>     - stop grabbing session with <session ID> (if it's not) and download grabbed files


FAQ
======================
1) What if connection between client and server hosts was lost?
In such case, LG on server will stop grabbing in a minute and resources will not be wasted. You can grab created files later
